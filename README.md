# SnakeGame
Classic game of snake

This is a game I created back in highschool. Using the p5.dom model, I taught myself a lot of JavaScript and eventually made this. 

Later, I watched a couple youtube videos about neural network machine learning and created a branch of this that spawns 100 snakes with randomized 'brains', and while using a genetic algorithm adapts to the best snake over time. 

Another branch of this has a couple 'good-snake's that did exceptionally well, such as winning the game perfectly in some cases. 

I haven't updated it since.
